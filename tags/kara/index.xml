PhD thesis
Abstract # At the time this thesis is written, the world finds itself amidst and partly in the process of recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-Cov-2 virus. One major contribution to the worldwide efforts of bringing this pandemic to an end are the vaccines developed by different research teams all around the globe. Produced in a remarkably short time frame, a crucial first step for the discovery of these vaccines was mapping out the atomic structure of the proteins making up the virus and their interactions.</description></item><item><title>Accelerated Deep Reinforcement Learning for Fast Feedback of Beam Dynamics at KARA</title><link>https://jank324.github.io/posts/publications/wang2021accelerated/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jank324.github.io/posts/publications/wang2021accelerated/</guid><description>W.

Abstract # Coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) is generated when the electron bunch length is in the order of the magnitude of the wavelength of the emitted radiation. The self-interaction of short electron bunches with their own electromagnetic fields changes the longitudinal beam dynamics significantly.</description></item><item><title>Feedback Design for Control of the Micro-Bunching Instability Based on Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://jank324.github.io/posts/publications/boltz2019feedback/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jank324.github.io/posts/publications/boltz2019feedback/</guid><description>T.

Abstract # The operation of ring-based synchrotron light sourceswith short electron bunches increases the emission of co-herent synchrotron radiation (CSR) in the THz frequencyrange. However, the micro-bunching instability resultingfrom self-interaction of the bunch with its own radiationfield limits stable operation with constant intensity of CSRemission to a particular threshold current.</description></item></channel></rss>
