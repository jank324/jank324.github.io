# Personal Homepage

This is the repository for my personal homepage. This repository is based on (forked from) our [RL4AA collaboration website](https://github.com/RL4AA/RL4AA.github.io) with some changes made to the theme, file structure and of course the content. It uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to build the site and the [Blowfish theme](https://blowfish.page).

## Pointers

Below I'm collecting pointers on how to do certain things for later reference.

### Building the website

Just clone the repository, change what you need to change and push back onto `main`. The website will be built automatically by GitHub my GitHub and is served from the `gh-pages` branch.
